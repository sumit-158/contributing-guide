pyOpenSci collaborates with organizations that support the scientific
community.

## Software peer review support for scientific communities
pyOpenSci is launching a prototype collaboration that supports an existing
scientific community.

### What pyOpenSci provides to existing communities
In addition to [the core benefits that pyOpenSci peer review provides](/about/benefits),
we also provide infrastructure and resources for:
* Peer review of tools in the community's ecosystem
* Adoption of community specific review standards which will be enforced in addition
 [to our existing review guidelines](editor-checklist-template)
* Maintenance support to maintainers that go through our review.
* Support for finding a new package maintainer in case the current one needs to step down.
* A catalog of vetted tools and a community landing page.

### Partnership benefits to the broader scientific community
The benefit of communities partnering with us is:

* We have a broad view across all scientific ecosystems which will help us to better identify overlap of package functions.
* We also have broader reach to users of scientific software across the ecosystem.
* Finally a consolidated peer review process will help enforce standardization of scientific Python packaging and best practices across the ecosystem.
