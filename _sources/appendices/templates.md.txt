< short greeting />

I'm writing to see if you'd be interested in participating with pyOpenSci, a new community around improving the quality of software in the scientific python stack.

pyOpenSci provides resources, mentoring, and documentation for making scientific python packages more useful and maintainable. It builds off of the successful rOpenSci model, with a Python flavor. It primarily coordinates a review process by which experienced developers in the scientific python ecosystem can provide feedback and suggestions to other (usually fairly small) packages.

You've been in the scientific Python community for some time now, and I think you'd be a great part of the pyOpenSci community. Would you be interested in joining us? Participation can be as small or large as you wish - for example, you could submit your own package for review in pyOpenSci, offer to be a reviewer of someone else's package, or begin attending pyOpenSci planning meetings as we build and refine our processes. We'd just be happy to have you around :-)

< short goodbye />
