Diagram showing the tiers of software in the python ecosystem starting with Python itself and as you move out packages become more domain specific. In this image packages like xarray and numpy are considered core to scientific python. Packages and distributions like astropy, simpeg and metpy are considered to be domain specific. pyOpenSci's review
process focuses on domain specific packages rather than core packages as
these packages tend to have more variability in long term maintenance and
package infrastructure and quality compared to established core packages. **Source: ["Jupyter meets earth" project](https://jupytearth.org/jupyter-resources/introduction/ecosystem.html)**

Currently, the packages that pyOpenSci reviews also need to fall into the
technical and applied scope of our organization. This scope may expand over time
as the organization grows.



## Is Your Package in Scope For pyOpenSci Review?

pyOpenSci only reviews packages that fall within our specified domain and
technical scope listed below.

If you are unsure whether your package is in scope for review, please
open a [pre-submission inquiry using a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/new?assignees=&labels=0%2Fpresubmission&template=presubmission-inquiry.md&title=) to get feedback from
one of our editors. We are happy to look at your package and help you understand
whether it is in scope or not.

## Package Overlap
pyOpenSci encourages competition among packages, forking and re-implementation
as they improve options of users. However, we strive to make packages in the
pyOpenSci suite to represent our top recommendations for the tasks that they
perform. We aim to avoid duplication of functionality of existing Python
packages in any repo without significant improvements. A Python package that
replicates the functionality of an existing package may be considered for
inclusion in the pyOpenSci suite if it significantly improves on alternatives by
being:

- More open in licensing or development practices
- Broader in functionality (e.g., providing access to more data sets, providing
a greater suite of functions), but not only by duplicating additional packages
- Better in usability and performance
- Actively maintained while alternatives are poorly or no longer actively maintained

These factors should be considered as a whole to determine if the package is a
significant improvement. A new package would not meet this standard only by
following our package guidelines while others do not, unless this leads to a
significant difference in the areas above.

We recommend that packages highlight differences from and improvements over
overlapping packages in their `README` and/or vignettes or get started tutorials.

We encourage developers whose packages are not accepted due to overlap to still
consider submittal to other repositories or journals.
